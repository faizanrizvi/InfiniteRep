## Project Aim and Objectives

### Project Aim:
The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive, open-source dataset that can be used for developing machine learning models focused on human pose estimation, exercise tracking, and remote physical therapy.

### Objectives:
- To provide a diverse set of synthetic video data featuring various exercises.
- To facilitate research in remote fitness and physical therapy using machine learning.
- To enable the development of pose estimation models for fitness applications.

## Dataset Features

1. **Synthetic Videos**: The dataset includes videos of a synthetic avatar performing various exercises such as push-ups, squats, and weightlifting.
2. **Keypoint Annotations**: Each frame in the video is annotated with 2D keypoints representing human joints (e.g., nose, eyes, shoulders, elbows).
3. **High-Quality Graphics**: The dataset features high-quality synthetic environments that simulate real-world conditions.
4. **Multiple Exercises**: The dataset includes a variety of exercises to ensure diversity in training data.
